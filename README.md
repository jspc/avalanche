# Avalanche

Avalanche is designed to mimic the behaviour of sudden increases and decreases in requests to the Snowplow Pipeline and the ability for the pipeline to scale up/down to match these changes.  This should assert that under any amount of load the pipeline will scale to compensate while not losing any data.

This tool is forked from https://github.com/snowplow/avalanche and is an erotic reimagining to provide idiomatic flood.io support
